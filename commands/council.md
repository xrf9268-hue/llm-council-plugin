# Council

Summon the LLM Council for multi-model deliberation on complex technical questions.

## Usage

```
/council "Your technical question here"
```

## Examples

```
/council "How should I optimize React component re-renders?"
/council "What's the best approach for implementing rate limiting in a Node.js API?"
/council "Review this algorithm for potential edge cases"
```

## What Happens

1. **Opinion Collection**: Your query is sent to OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini, and Claude in parallel
2. **Peer Review**: Each model anonymously reviews the others' responses
3. **Synthesis**: The Chairman (Claude Opus) synthesizes all inputs into a final verdict

## Implementation Instructions

When this command is invoked:

1. **Parse Input**: Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the user's complete technical question (everything typed after `/council`).

2. **Activate Skill**: Use the **Skill tool** to activate the `council-orchestrator` skill.

3. **Pass Parameters**: Forward `$ARGUMENTS` as the `{query}` parameter to the skill.

4. **Monitor Progress**: Display progress updates to the user as the council deliberates:
   - "🔍 Consulting council members..."
   - "⚖️ Running peer review phase..."
   - "📊 Chairman synthesizing verdict..."

5. **Return Results**: Present the final Markdown report generated by the council to the user.

**Note**: This command uses Sonnet 4.5 because council orchestration involves complex multi-step reasoning: coordinating parallel API calls, parsing responses, managing peer review logic, and synthesizing diverse opinions into a coherent final report.
