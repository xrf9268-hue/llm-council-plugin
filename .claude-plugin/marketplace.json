  "description": "Multi-model consensus engine that summons OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini, and Claude to collaboratively answer your technical questions through peer review and synthesis.",
  "longDescription": "The LLM Council plugin transforms Claude Code into a multi-model deliberation system. When you have a complex technical question, instead of getting one perspective, you get three AI models working together:\n\n1. **Opinion Collection**: Your question is sent to Claude, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini in parallel\n2. **Peer Review**: Each model anonymously reviews the others' responses, identifying strengths and weaknesses\n3. **Chairman Synthesis**: Claude Opus synthesizes all inputs into a final verdict with consensus points and areas of disagreement\n\nPerfect for architecture decisions, code reviews, debugging complex issues, and any question where multiple perspectives add value.",
